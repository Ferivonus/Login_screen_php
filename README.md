# username-and-password-php
I wrote a code for using forms to getting more access to a website with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
let Website_userName = ['******','***'];
let Website_Password = ['Co*de9','MyC*de8'];
With these, there is a format for username and password too, username and password's length have to between 5 and 20 with that, password at least have to be a special character and integer.
